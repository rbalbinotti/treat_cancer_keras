tyrosine kinase domain in 30 of acute myeloid leukemia aml cases13 alternatively flt3 can also be activated by mutations in the kinase domain such as the d835y mutation which are observed in 7 of aml cases12 both in vitro and in vivo data have demonstrated that flt3itd and flt3d835y encode constitutively activated kinases that drive the proliferation and survival of hematopoietic cells furthermore flt3itd mutations confer a bad prognosis in aml145 and flt3 inhibitors are expected to improve the outcome of aml patients in this subgroup these data provide the rationale for the use of flt3 kinase inhibitors for the treatment of aml2  while preclinical experiments with cellbased assays and mouse models documented a potent effect of various flt3 kinase inhibitors first clinical trials showed only moderate efficacy2 one complicating factor for the treatment of aml is the heterogeneity of the disease with flt3 mutations being only one of the many mutations present in human aml samples molecular data also suggest that flt3 mutations tend to occur late in the multistep development of aml limiting the effect of flt3 inhibitors to the subset of aml cells within the leukemia that harbor flt3 mutations  in an ongoing multinational phase ii trial of the flt3 inhibitor ac220 as monotherapy a complete remission rate of 45 was reported at an interim report at the eha meeting in 201167 despite these promising results patients treated with ac220 develop resistance to this inhibitor and smith et al have demonstrated that this is due to the acquisition of flt3 kinase mutations8 in that study mutations at 3 different positions in the kinase domain of flt3 were identified that confer resistance to ac220 f691 d835 and y8428 these mutations were identified by an in vitro resistance screen and in aml samples obtained from patients who developed resistance to ac220 treatment although these mutations conferred resistance to ac220 defined by a clear shift in the ic50 values compared to flt3itd and by their identification as acquired mutations in relapsed patients during ac220 treatment they could still be inhibited by higher concentrations of the drug  eight years ago we predicted resistance mutations in the flt3 kinase domain using an in vitro mutagenesis technology in flt3itd transformed baf3 cells9 in this way we identified 3 positions in flt3 n676 f691 and g697 that upon mutation conferred high level resistance to pkc412 one of these mutations n676d was later also identified as a resistance mutation in an aml patient treated with pkc412 indicating the validity of the in vitro predictions10 the f691l mutation in flt3 was recently identified as a resistance mutation in aml patients treated with ac2208  here we show that also the g697r and n676d mutations confer resistance to ac220 baf3 cells dependent on the expression of flt3itd or flt3itd with additional n676d f691i f691l or g697r mutation were treated with increasing concentrations of ac220 we measured the proliferation of these cells over a period of 24 h and we determined the level of autophosphorylation of flt3 as a measurement of its activity after 90 min of inhibitor treatment all mutations conferred resistance to ac220 with g697r and f691li mutations being the most resistant and n676d conferring a lower level of resistance figure 1 in addition we also used the baf3 cells expressing flt3d835y and we observed that also these cells were highly resistant to ac220 figure 1  figure 1 figure 1 sensitivity of flt3itd mutants to the ac220 inhibitor baf3 cells expressing flt3itd w51 mutation as described by kelly et al11 flt3d835y and different flt3itd mutants were treated with increasing concentrations of ac220 and their proliferation  our data show that there are additional mutations that confer resistance to ac220 in particular the g697r mutation that confers resistance similar to the recently described f691l mutation all these mutations can be easily acquired by a single nucleotide change in the flt3 gene sequence notably the f691l g697r and n676d mutations that confer resistance to ac220 remain sensitive to ponatinib or sorafenib other known flt3 inhibitors currently being tested in clinical trials these results point out that combinations of ac220 and ponatinib or sorafenib may be useful to overcome resistance to single agents1213\",\n

discussion relevance of structures for drug discovery the structures of the human btkkd y551edasatinib and btkkdb43 complexes we report here differ from the publicly available structure of apomurine btkkd pdb id 1k2p and are arguably more relevant for drug discovery for diseases in which inhibition of btk may be desired when the apomouse btk structure is superimposed on the human btkkdb43 structure rmsd of 119 a\\u02da over 230 aligned acarbons the biggest differences are observed in the activation loop and in the glycinerich loop the activation loop of the mouse apobtkkd structure adapts an extended configuration with tyr551 pointed toward solvent in the mouse apobtk structure the glycine loop also caves into the active site and occludes the atp binding pocket because the mouse and human btkkds are 983 identical and only four amino acids are replaced in the mouse sequence q379k k433r k625r and t653s it is likely that the kinase domain flexibility observed in the apomurine btkkd structure is due to a lack of occupancy of a compound in the active site rather than due to an intrinsic structural difference between the mouse and human species selectivity of compound inhibition for both dasatinib and the reversible celera compound the size and hydrogen bonding nature of the gatekeeper residue of a given kinase generally correlates with its degree of biochemical inhibition9 table ii most of the kinases that are inhibited by 10 lm dasatinib with a kd < 1 nm or that are inhibited by 10 lm celera compound with less than 5 residual activity have a threonine gatekeeper a valine residue in this gatekeeper position is tolerated for the celera compound binding but is not as well tolerated for dasatinib binding to the ret and kdr kinases table ii because the threonine gatekeeper forms hbond interactions with both compounds it is possible that the hbonding binding energy plays a greater role in binding dasatinib compared to the celera compound an alternative explanation for the poor binding of dasatinib to valine gatekeeper containing kinases kdr and ret is that there are differences in side chains within 5 a\\u02da of the compound table iii in particular one residue in the back pocket that forms close hydrophobic interactions with dasatinib in btk is met449 which is replaced by a leucine in kdr and ret because the back pocket in the

1snu and p38a yellow pdb id 1p38 this indicates that the larger phenylalanine gatekeeper of itk compared to the thr474 gatekeeper of btk prevents b43 from binding it also indicates that the shorter hinge of p38a blocks the b43 binding site b overlay of b43 structure green and dasatinib structure magenta indicates that they superimpose well near the hinge but differ near the chelix resulting in a

mixed hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues dasatinib may have a greater reliance on met449 compared to b43 whose back pocket is completely surrounded by hydrophobic residues either explanation ie different energy considerations for hbonding to a threonine gatekeeper for different compounds or differences in the makeup of side chains that line dasatinibs unique hydrophobic pocket could explain why dasatinib does not bind as well to ret and kdr the exception to the rule of requiring a small gatekeeper for compound binding is p38a egfr and nima never in mitosis gene arelated kinase 11 nek11 kinases which have threonine gatekeepers but are only moderately inhibited by both small molecules p38a kinase has a shorter hinge and thus its reduced affinity can be ascribed to a smaller binding site fig 3a similarly there are differences in the other residues within 5 a\\u02da of the two small molecules table iii which could account for the differences in affinity for nek11 and egfr both differ in the residues that make up the hydrophobic pocket behind the threonine gatekeeper with egfr substituting a cysteine for val458 and nek11 substituting a larger phenylalanine for leu460 and a leucine for met449 furthermore nek11 contains a glycine substitution for ser538 a residue which is likely to enhance the flexibility of the dfg motif which follows table iii in contrast abl lyn and src kinases which are inhibited well by both small molecules show no significant variation in the residues that make up the hydrophobic pocket in these kinases ser538 is replaced with alanine a residue with similar conformational flexibility and is not likely to effect the flexibility of the activation loop tables ii and iii as the size of the gatekeeper residue increases from threonine to phenylalanine as in itk fig 3a methionine as in igf1r jak1 jnk3 and syk table ii or leucine as in aurora a table ii neither inhibitor reduces kinase activity to the full extent because both binding

kinase domain overall conformational changes in the btkkd y551edasatinib complex structure the glyrich loop of btk partially shields dasatinib from solvent as found in the abl kinase structure data not shown because of the curledin glycinerich loop in the btk structure a hydrophobic interaction is formed between phe413 and the exocyclic methyl of the dasatinib pyridine ring fig 1d and between gln412 and asp539 of the dfg motif in every other respect however the overall conformation of the btkkddasatinib structure is similar to the known dasatinibbound conformations of lyn18 csrc19 and abl17 including the compounds hbond interactions with the hinge and the position of its chelix the nonvisible residues differ between the two btk structures which can be correlated with the different interactions made with different compounds or by the mutation in the activation loop the tip of the glycinerich loop is disordered in the b43 structure but is ordered in the dasatinib structure while the activation loop is disordered in the dasatinib structure but is well ordered in the b43 structure the curled glycinerich loop forms van der waals contacts with dasatinib between a methyl substituent and the phe413 side chain whereas no similar interactions take place between b43 and the btkkd protein residues and the glycinerich loop is disordered one might expect that the y551e mutation in the activation loop of the btkkd y551edasatinib structure is responsible for the activation loop disorder the mutated residue is electrostatically incompatible with the conformation of the activation loop seen in the btkkdb43 structure in the btkkdb43 structure the y551 residue is in close proximity to an asp521 side chain this is likely to be electrostatically repelled by mutation of the tyrosine to a glutamate while it is often hard to pinpoint why flexible regions of crystal structures are disordered it appears that formation of critical molecular interactions produces ordered electron density for the more flexible regions of btk comparison of the structures of the human btkkdy551edasatinib complex and the btkkdb43 complex reveals a change of conformation from catalytically active to inactive the dasatinib complex is more similar to the atpbound conformation of most kinases in which a conserved glutamate from the chelix forms a salt bridge to the catalytic lysine in fact no crystals could be formed with the unphosphorylated wildtype btk kinase construct prompting us to make the y551e mutant as a mimic of the phosphorylated wildtype protein in contrast the btkkdb43 complex shows an outward shift of the chelix fig 3b relative to its position in the dasatinib structure the conserved salt bridge from the glutamate to the catalytic lysine breaks and a large hydrophobic pocket opens behind the gatekeeper residue the ability of different kinases to adapt a chelix out conformation might enable the design of specific inhibitors that targets this larger hydrophobic pocket furthermore cys481 in the active site of btkkd could also be exploited to gain kinase selectivity in which a small molecule may be irreversibly bound to this cysteine via a covalent bond11 to determine the overall similarity of the btkkdb43 structure to other kinases the b43 complex structure was submitted to the dalilite server for structure alignment and scoring20 httpekhidna

y551edasatinib structure is similar to the active csrc csk structure pdb id 1y57 where the activation loop is swung out and the chelix moves toward the active site fig 4 comparison of src and tec family kinases the phosphorylationtriggered regulation of btk and src differ unlike the src family the tec family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases lacks a conserved tyrosine in the cterminus that could be phosphorylated to then bind to the sh2 domain16 btk is regulated by the phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues tyr223 in the sh3 domain and tyr551 in the activation loop of the kinase domain both of which participate in kinase activation21 in a recent study of btk autophosphorylation the y551f mutant was shown to have a 5 to 10fold lower enzymatic activity than the wildtype protein indicating that this tyrosine plays an important role in btk activation22 furthermore mutation of a conserved tryptophan in the nterminal wex motif in which x is a hydrophobic residue also appears to effect the activities of the two kinase families differently in src mutation of the trp to ala increases kinase activity while in btk mutation of the trp to ala reduces kinase activity23 the human btk structures described here include ordered density for the wei motif residues 392395 an area which was disordered in the marcotte et al protein science vol 19429\\u2014439 435 available murine btk structure pdb id 1k2p and the human itk structure pdb id 1sm2 this enables a structural comparison of the tec family and the src family kinases in this conserved region the trp side chain shifts from being solvent exposed in the inactive btkkdb43 complex structure to being wedged into a pocket behind the inward chelix in the active btkkd y551edasatinib complex structure fig 4ab a structural superposition of the two btk structures with the inactive src pdb id 2src 24 and an active csk structure pdb id 1y57 16 show that the side chain of trp395 superimposes in the active structures of both kinase families in the inactive conformations a lysine or methionine side chain from the rotated chelix sterically occludes the tryptophan side chain and the trp side chains are not superimposable fig 4b the similar structural shift observed suggests that the src and tec families utilize a similar means of activating the conformation of the kinase domain however the inactive conformations of the trp side chain differ and the differential energy required in switching from inactive to active conformations may differ this could explain why mutation of this residue to alanine produces different regulatory effects on the two proteins this study reports the structures of human btkkd with dasatinib or 4amino54phenoxyphenyl 7hpyrrolo23dpyrimidin7ylcyclopentane bound at the active site analysis of the binding modes reveals that the size and hbonding potential of the gatekeeper residue in different kinases and the nature of the residues that make up the hydrophobic pocket behind the gatekeeper residue are critical in dictating if either compound binds we propose that the presence of a distinct hydrophobic pocket in the b43 structure suggests that one could design compounds with limited selectivity for kinases that can adapt the chelixout conformation movements in the chelix presumably induced by phosphorylation of the activation loop residue tyr551 can shift btk into an active conformation and could generate a second metal binding site containing glu445 that lin et al have shown is important for optimal catalytic activity of the tyr551phosphorylated btk25 finally we show that like the srcfamily of kinases btk can adapt a similar conformational rotamer of trp395 in its active conformation which is correlated with a similar movement of the chelix with a growing recognition that btk plays a key role in many b cell lymphomas and autoimmune diseases these structures will assist with selective drug design  brutons tyrosine kinase btk is required for b cell development and b cell antigen receptor bcr function crosslinking of bcr induces phosphorylation of btk at tyr551 and tyr223 however the functional requirement of these phosphorylation for bcr signaling remains unclear we demonstrate here that mutation of tyr551 not tyr223 abrogates the bcrinduced calcium mobilization not only lyn but also syk was required for tyrosine phosphorylation of btk in bcr signaling these results suggest that transphosphorylation of btk on tyr551 is essential for bcr function and that this phosphorylation is mediated through the concerted actions of lyn and syk  the b cell antigen receptor bcr1 is composed of surface immunoglobulin noncovalently associated with a pair of ig\\u03b1ig\\u03b2 disulfidelinked heterodimers which are essential for signal transduction stimulation of the bcr induces the enzymatic activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of three distinct families of nonreceptor cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases ptks the src family syk and btk the src family kinases are rapidly activated after bcr engagement and their activation correlates with the initial tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosinebased activation motif on the bcr ig\\u03b1 and ig\\u03b2 subunits reviewed in refs14  temporally activation of src family kinases is followed by btk and syk 5 this sequential activation potentially places btk and syk downstream of src family kinases utilizing cooverexpression system in fibroblasts and cos cells it has been demonstrated that lyn transphosphorylates btk on tyr551 in the catalytic domain a site homologous to the src family kinase consensus autophosphorylation site 6 7 this results in a 510fold increase in btk enzymatic activity 7 the increase in activity also leads to increased autophosphorylation at tyr223 in the sh3 domain of btk 8 the identical phosphopeptides were generated after crosslinking of the bcr indicating that these sites are also tyrosine phosphorylated in b cells 7 although the importance of phosphorylation of tyr551 and tyr223 for fibroblast transformation has been examined 8 9 functional significance of phosphorylation of tyr551 and tyr223 of btk in bcr signaling remains elusive  to genetically define the functional relationship among lyn syk and btk in bcr signaling we established each ptkdeficient dt40 b cells 10 11 our previous results have shown that the bcrinduced calcium mobilization is abrogated in btkdeficient dt40 cells and that the loss of btk does not significantly affect the activation of lyn and syk in bcr signaling 11 here we show that bcrinduced tyrosine phosphorylation of btk is abolished in lynsyk doubledeficient dt40 cells suggesting that btk acts downstream of lyn andor syk in bcr signaling moreover this phosphorylation is partially inhibited in lyn or sykdeficient cells indicating contribution of both lyn and syk to btk phosphorylation the btk y223f mutant was able to restore the bcrinduced calcium mobilization whereas the y551f mutant could not thus these results suggest that phosphorylation of tyr551 of btk through lyn and syk is essential for bcr signaling  previous section next section

tyrosine phosphorylation following bcr engagement we utilized three mutants of the chicken b cell line dt40 generated by inactivation of either lyn syk or both genes by homologous recombination 10 11 since the ab raised against chicken btk does not immunoprecipitate efficiently we expressed an epitopetagged version of btk designated t7btk into wild type and these mutant dt40 cells clones expressing similar levels of t7btk in these deficient dt40 cells were selected these clones were lysed prior to and following bcr ligation and t7btk was immunoprecipitated with antit7 mab as shown in fig 1 btk was inducibly tyrosinephosphorylated following bcr stimulation in wild type dt40 cells consistent with previous reports 5 1315 in contrast to wild type cells lynsyk doubledeficient dt40 cells failed to exhibit any btk tyrosine phosphorylation following bcr ligation indicating requirement of lyn andor syk for the bcrinduced tyrosine phosphorylation of btk in lyndeficient dt40 cells tyrosine phosphorylation of btk at 1 and 3 min after bcr ligation was significantly reduced whereas this phosphorylation at 10 min reached almost the same level as that in wild type cells compared with lyndeficient dt40 cells sykdeficient cells showed a complementary time course of the bcrinduced phosphorylation of btk phosphorylation of btk was only observed at 1 and 3 min after bcr stimulation these data suggest that either lyn or syk alone is capable of phosphorylating btk at least to some extent and that the concerted actions of lyn and syk are required for full

transphosphorylation of btk at tyr551 results in increased its enzymatic activity leading to autophosphorylation of a second tyrosine tyr223 in a fibroblast system 8 to determine that this sequential phosphorylation of btk occurs also after bcr stimulation we transfected y551f and y223f mutants of btk into btkdeficient dt40 cells fig 2 a stimulation of bcr did not enhance tyrosine phosphorylation of btky551f fig 3 this result suggests the possibility that tyr551 of btk is only target of lynsykdependent phosphorylation after bcr stimulation in dt40 cells alternatively phosphorylation at tyr551 is a critical step for subsequent phosphorylation of btk in bcr signaling context in contrast to btky551f btky223f showed increased tyrosine phosphorylation upon bcr stimulation although this phosphorylation was only observed at 1 min after receptor crosslinking fig 3 thus these results implicate that a primary target of tyrosine through concerted actions of lyn and syk is tyr551 of btk in bcr signaling leading to phosphorylation of tyr223 since btky223f did not show significant tyrosine phosphorylation at 3 and 10 min after receptor stimulation our finding also suggests that phosphorylation of tyr223 is required for sustained btk phosphorylation in bcr signaling  figure 2 view larger version in this page in a new window download as powerpoint slide figure 2 schematic

kinases when the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation is normalized to the amount of protein present in each kinase assay both btky551f and btky223f had similar transphosphorylation activity compared with wild type btk fig2 b we showed previously that the bcrinduced plc\\u03b32 activation is abrogated in btkdeficient dt40 cells leading to loss of calcium mobilization 11 thus we examined whether these mutations were able to restore these defects or not as shown in fig4 a dt40 cells expressing btky223f exhibited normal calcium mobilization whereas btky551f was able to mobilize only small amount of calcium upon receptor crosslinking consistent with these data crosslinking of bcr on dt40 cells expressing btky223f stimulated inositol 145trisphosphate ip3 production and tyrosine phosphorylation of plc\\u03b32 although these parameters were lower than wild type btk fig 4b and c this might reflect the lower expression level of btky223f than wild type btk fig 2 b the bcrinduced

cells bcrinduced tyrosine phosphorylation of btk was significantly inhibited at 1 and 3 min after stimulation fig 1 indicating that btk phosphorylation is mediated by lyn in bcr signaling in these early time points however at 10 min after stimulation this phosphorylation reached almost the same level in wild type cells suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of btk at 10 min after bcr stimulation is independent of lyn in contrast to lyndeficient dt40 cells sykdeficient cells show the profound inhibition of the bcrinduced tyrosine phosphorylation of btk at 10 min after receptor crosslinking implicating that this btk phosphorylation is mediated by syk taken together these data suggest that the initial btk phosphorylation and sustained phosphorylation are mediated by coordinated actions of lyn and syk after bcr crosslinking  our conclusion is somewhat inconsistent with the previous reports using cos cell and fibroblast expression systems 6 7 in these systems lyn is able to phosphorylate btk whereas syk is not one of the possibilities about this disparity between the heterologous systems and dt40 b cell system is that syk is maximally activated through transphosphorylation at tyr518 andor tyr519 by lyn in dt40 cells 16 in contrast overexpressed syk itself may not be fully activated in heterologous systems to test this possibility we transfected t7btk into sykdeficient cells expressing syk mutant in which tyr518tyr519 is changed to phe518phe519 in this mutant dt40 cell the bcrinduced tyrosine phosphorylation of btk was similar to that in sykdeficient dt40 cells data not shown implicating that the requirement of syk is due to upregulated syk through transphosphorylation of tyr518tyr519 it is also possible that btk may not be a direct substrate of syk assuming that another ptk acts downstream of syk in bcr signaling our data might be accounted for by the involvement of this sykregulated ptk in tyrosine phosphorylation of btk  it has been reported that two tyrosines tyr551 and tyr223 are phosphorylated after crosslinking of bcr btky551f exhibited no tyrosine phosphorylation upon bcr crosslinking whereas btky223f showed an increase of tyrosine phosphorylation at 1 min after receptor stimulation suggesting that tyr551 phosphorylation is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation of btk in bcr signaling events thus these results support the previous contention that phosphorylation of btk at tyr551 is followed by its autophosphorylation at tyr223 7 8 since btky223f did not show significant tyrosine phosphorylation at 3 and 10 min after receptor stimulation phosphorylation of tyr223 appears to be required for sustained btk phosphorylation recent crystallographic analysis of itk btktec family ptk expressed in t cells may provide insights into the function of phosphorylation of tyr223 of btk 17 based on this analysis the prolinerich domain adjacent to the sh3 domain of btktec family kinases contains an sh3 ligand fig 2 a allowing intramolecular interaction interestingly tyr223of btk is located within the interface of this interaction thus phosphorylation of tyr223 may disrupt this intramolecular interaction thereby changing the conformation of btk this conformational change might be required for sustained phosphorylation of btk in bcr signaling  our functional data clearly indicate that tyr551 is essential for bcr signaling whereas tyr223 is dispensable for bcrinduced plc\\u03b32 activation since phosphorylation of tyr551 was already reported to increase the kinase activity of btk with 510fold 7 one of the consequence of phosphorylation of tyr551 is increased kinase activity upon bcr crosslinking although we carried out in vitro kinase assay on btk immunoprecipitates in wild type dt40 cells the bcrinduced activation of its in vitro kinase activity could not be reproducibly observed previous reports suggest that the magnitude of the bcrinduced activation of btk is significantly smaller than that of maximum btk phosphorylation by lyn in heterologous systems 6 7 indeed in our hand this 510fold activation of btk in cos cells could be reproducibly detected thus the most likely explanation is that the increase of btk enzymatic activity through phosphorylation of tyr551 in dt40 cells is too small for our detection system  in the case of syk it has been demonstrated that in addition to recruitment of syk to phosphorylated ig\\u03b1ig\\u03b2 phosphorylation at tyrosine tyr519 andor tyr518 within its activation loop is critical for bcr signal transduction 16 in this report we show that phosphorylation of tyr551 on btk activation loop is also an obligatory mechanism for its participation in bcr signaling thus cytoplasmic ptk cascade through phosphorylation of tyrosine located in the activation loop may be one of the general mechanisms for cytoplasmic signal transduction  the tec family kinases are tyrosine kinases that function primarily in hematopoietic cells the catalytic activity of the tec kinases is positively influenced by the regulatory domains outside of the kinase domain the current lack of a fulllength tec kinase structure leaves a void in our understanding of how these positive regulatory signals are transmitted to the kinase domain recently a conserved structure within kinases the regulatory spine has been identified that assembles and disassembles as a kinase switches between its active and inactive states here we define the residues that comprise the regulatory spine within tec kinases compared to previously characterized systems the tec kinases contain an extended regulatory spine that includes a conserved methionine within the chelix and a conserved tryptophan within the sh2kinase linker of tec kinases this extended regulatory spine forms a conduit for transmitting the presence of the regulatory domains of tec kinases to the catalytic domain we further show that mutation of the gatekeeper residue at the edge of the regulatory spine stabilizes the regulatory spine resulting in a constitutively active kinase domain importantly the regulatory spine is preassembled in this gatekeeper mutant rendering phosphorylation on the activation loop unnecessary for its activity moreover we show that the disruption of the conserved electrostatic interaction between btk r544 on the activation loop and btk e445 on the chelix also aids in the assembly of the regulatory spine thus the extended regulatory spine is a key structure that is critical for maintaining the activity of tec kinases  keywords itk and btk regulatory spine kinase activation gatekeeper residue phosphorylation go to introduction protein kinases catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from atp to a hydroxyl containing amino acid side chain either serthr for serinethreonine kinases or tyr for tyrosine kinases1 the activity of protein kinases is exquisitely regulated within the cell1 2 3 4 the switch from the catalytically inactive state of a kinase to the active state is often accompanied by the phosphorylation of a key residue within the activation loop a large flexible loop that lies between the two lobes of the kinase domain structure1 phosphorylation of the activation loop residue can trigger concerted movements in other mobile elements within the kinase domain such as the chelix and the dfg motif that brings about the assembly of the catalytically critical residues in the kinase active state1 the active state conformations associated with different kinases are nearly identical across the many kinases for which high resolution structures have been solved2 3 5 6 7 it is not surprising that the active states of distinct kinases are very similar since the phosphotransfer chemistry carried out by different kinases is the same in contrast it is becoming clear that the structural features associated with the inactive state of various kinases differ widely  the search for features that are conserved within the structures of active kinases has recently led to the identification of a structure termed the regulatory spine8 9 the regulatory spine was first identified by local spatial patterns alignment analysis using a set of serinethreonine and tyrosine kinase structures that included pka as a model kinase8 9 the regulatory spine defines a stretch of amino acid residues that is assembled only in the active state of kinases unlike consensus sequences that consist of a continuous stretch of amino acids in the primary structure the regulatory spine consists of disparate residues that span the n and cterminal lobes of the kinase domain assembly of the regulatory spine has been proposed to be a crucial step in the activation of protein kinases and this structure is disrupted in structures of kinases in the inactive state moreover the regulatory spine has been proposed as the mechanism by which allosteric effects can be propagated to the kinase active site8 9  the tec kinases are immunologically related tyrosine kinases which consist of five mammalian members itk btk tec txk and bmx10 11 tec kinases share similar domain architecture as src abl and csk family of kinases in that they have the sh3sh2kinase domain cassette10 despite domain similarities we and others have shown that the regulation of tec kinases is distinct from src and abl kinases10 12 13 14 unlike the src and abl kinases the nterminal regulatory domains of tec kinases positively regulate the activity of the kinase domain14 while the isolated kinase domains of src and abl are active the isolated kinase domains of the tec family exhibit poor catalytic activity13 14 15 regulation of the tec kinases is in fact more similar to the csk family of enzymes whose nterminal regulatory domains are essential for the catalytic activity of the kinase domain16 moreover while the structures of fulllength src and csk kinases are available the structure of a fulllength tec kinase remains elusive2 17 18 this leaves a significant gap in our mechanistic understanding of the regulation of the tec family kinases  in this manuscript we define the regulatory spine within the tec family kinases and show that mutation of the spine residues leads to different effects in the context of the isolated kinase domain verses fulllength itk moreover we show that the assembly of a stable regulatory spine within members of the tec kinase family is critically dependent on the presence of the sh2kinase linker region the residues that comprise the regulatory spine within pka are insufficient to promote the assembly of a stable regulatory spine within the tec kinases we extend the tec regulatory spine to include a conserved methionine within the chelix and a conserved tryptophan residue within the sh2kinase linker of tec kinases together with the spine residues originally identified within the pka kinase domain the conserved methionine and tryptophan residues form a continuous structure that links the kinase active site to the nterminal regulatory domains of tec kinases furthermore we show that the stabilization of the regulatory spine by the gatekeeper threonine to methionine mutation eliminates the need for phosphorylation on the activation loop for btk kinase activity thus the extended regulatory spine is a structure that is critical for the regulation of tec kinases and if stabilized appropriately is sufficient for activation in the absence of activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation and in the absence of the noncatalytic tec regulatory domains  go to results the regulatory spine controls tec kinase activity  the regulatory spine within pka consists of five residues l95 l106 y164 f185 and d2209 these residues are spread throughout the primary sequence of the pka kinase domain l95 is located on the chelix l106 is on the nterminus of the \\u03b24 strand y164 is part of the hrd motif f185 is from the dfg motif and d220 is on the fhelix within the cterminal lobe9 alignment of the structure of the btk and itk kinase domains with that of pka shows that the corresponding regulatory spine residues within the btk and itk kinase domains should consist of btk m449 l460 h519 f540 and d579 and itk m409 l420 h479 f500 and d539 respectively fig 1a  figure 1 figure 1 identification of the regulatory spine in tec kinases to test the role of the predicted spine residues in the tec kinases we wished to take advantage of the rapid bacterial expression and purification system that has been developed for the isolated kinase domains of itk and btk19 one issue that arises however is the fact that the isolated kinase domains of the tec kinases exhibit poor catalytic activity and so the expected loss of function mutations in the regulatory spine would be difficult to characterize given the already low activity of the wild type kinase domains in order to take advantage of the ease of the bacterial expression system we needed an isolated btk and itk kinase domain with higher catalytic activity it has been demonstrated previously that introduction of a bulky hydrophobic residue such as isoleucine or methionine at the gatekeeper position activates multiple kinases20 indeed we find that the itk f434m and btk t474m isolated kinase domains are more active when compared to wildtype isolated kinase domain manuscript in preparation we therefore probed the importance of the predicted regulatory spine residues in itk and btk by mutating them individually to alanine in the context of the itk f434m and btk t474m isolated kinase domain mutants activity measurements are carried out by monitoring the phosphorylation levels of a peptide substrate in a radioactive assay or by detecting the level of autophosphorylation on the activation loop tyrosine y511 in itk and y551 in btk by western immunoblotting while phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine is achieved by the activity of the src family kinases lck and lyn respectively in vivo under in vitro conditions tec kinases autophosphorylate on the activation loop tyrosine21 22 23  disruption of the regulatory spine residues by mutation to alanine is predicted to disrupt kinase activity indeed mutation of btk m449 h519 f540 and d579 and itk m409 h479 f500 and d539 to alanine within the isolated kinase domain of itk f434m and btk t474m leads to decreased phosphorylation on the activation loop tyrosine and drastically reduces the catalytic activity fig 1b c d and e itk kinase residues such as m409 f500 and h479 are highly conserved with other kinases with welldefined roles in catalysis8 itk m409 is involved in binding the substrate atp12 itk f500 is part of the dfg motif at the start of the activation loop segment and is responsible for stabilizing the conformation of the preceding aspartate and the chelix8 itk h479 is part of the hrd motif where it serves as a scaffold for d499 and f5008 it is therefore not surprising that mutation at these sites leads to a loss in activity however itk d539 is not part of any previously characterized regulatory motif and therefore the drastic reduction in itk activity upon mutation of this residue to alanine highlights the importance of the regulatory spine in regulating itk activity moreover since the regulatory spine residues are conserved within the tec kinase family this structure would be predicted to be critical for regulating the activity of all tec kinase family members  unexpectedly mutation of itk l420 and btk l460 to alanine which based on the previous pka work is predicted to be part of the regulatory spine failed to inactivate the isolated kinase domains of itk f434m or btk t474m fig 1b c d and e in fact the isolated kinase domains of both itk l420af434m and btk l460at474m double mutants showed an increase in activity when compared to the isolated kinase domain of itk f434m and btk t474m respectively to ensure that the activating effect of the leu to ala mutation was not an artifact of working with the activated gatekeeper mutant isolated kinase domains of itk and btk the regulatory spine residues were mutated to alanine in the context of wildtype isolated kinase domains of itk and btk since the catalytic activity of the isolated kinase domain of tec kinases is generally poor the detection of activation loop phosphorylation levels by western immunoblotting is difficult and for itk in particular phosphorylation y511 is below the detection limit by western immunoblotting hence the activity of the wildtype and regulatory spine mutants of the isolated kinase domains of itk and btk are monitored by their ability to phosphorylate a peptide substrate in the radioactive assay  the results of the regulatory spine mutations in the context of the wild type kinase domains mirror the results for the activating gatekeeper mutants described above mutation of btk m449 h519 f540 and d579 to alanine within the isolated wild type kinase domain of btk leads to decreased catalytic activity fig 1f circular dichroism spectra of the btk mutants overlay well with that of wildtype btk showing that the decreased activity of the btk mutants are not due to unfolding of the kinase supp fig 1 since the activity of the isolated itk wildtype kinase domain is not significantly above background levels the resulting activity of the itk spine mutants itk m409a h479a f500a and d539a can not be interpreted except to say activity is no greater than wild type fig 1g however consistent with our earlier results with the gatekeeper mutant the itk l420a and btk l460a mutants are both more active than wildtype isolated kinase domain of itk and btk respectively fig 1f and g interestingly previous studies on the regulatory spine within the abl kinase have shown that mutation of abl l320 to glycine corresponding to itk l420 and btk l460 leads to only a slight decrease in kinase activity of full length abl20 this is also consistent with modeling studies of abl that have shown that abl l320 has a modest impact on regulatory spine formation20 thus itk l420 and btk l460 do not play a major role in the assembly of the regulatory spine within the context of the isolated kinase domain of itk and btk  the regulatory spine is not assembled in the structure of phosphorylated itk kinase domain  activation of tec kinases requires the phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine within the activation loop12 21 23 separate highresolution structures of the btk kinase domain with y551 either phosphorylated active or unphosphorylated inactive have recently been reported24 a comparison of the inactive and active states of btk kinase domain shows clear differences in the region of the regulatory spine fig 2a the regulatory spine residues assemble into a linear arrangement in the structure of the active btk kinase while interactions between the regulatory spine residues in particular l460 m449 and f540 are disrupted in the structure of inactive btk kinase the structural differences in this region between active and inactive btk are consistent with the role of the regulatory spine as defined previously for pka fig 2a  figure 2 figure 2 the regulatory spine is assembled only in the active state of kinases crystal structures of the isolated kinase domain of itk that is either unphosphorylated or phosphorylated on y511 in the activation loop are also available12 surprisingly the available itk kinase domain structures overlay quite well with little or no conformational differences between them regardless of the phosphorylation state of the activation loop inspection of the itk kinase domain structures shows that the regulatory spine residues in the itk kinase domain structures adopt a disrupted configuration similar to the inactive btk kinase domain fig 2b an additional hallmark of an active kinase domain structure is the formation of a crucial ion pair between a conserved lysine positioned within the \\u03b23 strand of the kinase domain and a conserved glutamate on the chelix1 the distance between the corresponding residues itk k390 and e405 within the structures of both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated itk kinase domain is on the order of 80 \\u00e5 which is significantly greater than the 3 to 4 \\u00e5 distance that is observed in the structures of other active kinases fig 2b12 indeed the distance between the same conserved ion pair within btk btk k430 and e445 changes from 146 to 38 \\u00e5 upon activation of the kinase fig 2a these observations suggest that both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated itk kinase domains adopt a conformation consistent with the inactive enzyme the inability of the itk kinase domain to fully assemble into an active conformation despite being phosphorylated on y511 in the itk activation loop points to additional requirements for activation  a notable difference between the itk and btk crystal structures is that the construct used for the crystallization of the btk kinase domain included the sh2kinase linker while that of the itk kinase did not fig 2a & b12 24 we hypothesize that the absence of the sh2kinase linker within the itk construct used for crystallography might prevent the assembly of a stable regulatory spine in the kinase domain despite phosphorylation on the activation loop y511  extension of the tec kinase regulatory spine  we have previously shown that the sh2kinase linker the 17 amino acids between the sh2 domain and the kinase domain is critical for the activity of both btk and itk exerting a positive effect on the catalytic function of the kinase domain14 more specifically a conserved tryprophan itk w355 btk w395 in the sh2kinase linker as well as a methionine residue in the c helix itk m410 btk m450 are crucial residues in the tec family kinase regulatory apparatus fig 3a14 like the regulatory spine mutants described in figure 1 point mutations of itk w355 btk w395 or itk m410 to alanine all result in a significant drop in catalytic activity fig 3b examination of the crystal structures of btk shows that btk w395 and btk m450 are located at the top of the regulatory spine and in the active btk structure serve to extend the hydrophobic packing of the spine residues well into the nterminus of the kinase domain fig 3c & d in the inactive btk structure repositioning of the w395 and m450 side chains disrupts the extended regulatory spine fig 3c & d in much the same manner that repositioning of m449 in the inactive btk structure disrupts the core of the spine fig 2a the active and inactive btk structures consist of the same amino acids residues 382659 and differ with respect to the activation loop tyrosine y551 in the active structure the activation loop tyrosine is mutated to glutamate y551e to mimic phosphorylated btk and for the inactive structure wild type btk in the unphosphorylated form was used for crystallization24  figure 3 figure 3 extension of the regulatory spine within tec kinases to include the sh2kinase linker compared to the regulatory spine that has been defined for pka9 the tec kinase family requires at least two additional residues itk w355 & m410 to fully assemble the regulatory spine the tryptophan residue is located in the sh2kinase linker region providing an explanation for the positive regulatory role of this noncatalytic region14 the available itk kinase domain structures are entirely consistent with this finding without the contribution of the sh2linker region the regulatory spine of itk does not assemble into the active conformation as a result the structures of the phosphorylated and unphosphorlated itk kinase domain fragments are very similar to each other and neither resembles an active kinase future structures of tec kinases with and without the sh2kinase linker in various activation phosphorylation states will be required to fully probe this hypothesis  itk l420 and btk l460 are essential for the formation of the extended regulatory spine within fulllength tec kinases  the conserved tryptophan in the sh2kinase linker is critical for the activity of fulllength tec kinases14 upon activation the tryptophan sidechain forms part of a hydrophobic pocket that is lined by the conserved methionine on the chelix and leucine on the \\u03b24 strand itk m410 l420 and btk m450 l460 fig 3d although itk l420 and btk l460 were shown to not be a part of the regulatory spine in the context of the isolated kinase domain fig 1 the structure of the btk kinase domain which contains the sh2kinase linker region suggests that this leucine would be critical for the formation of the extended regulatory spine in the context of the fulllength kinase we therefore tested the role of this leucine in the context of fulllength itk  as shown in figure 3e mutation of itk l420 to alanine within the context of fulllength itk disrupted the activity of itk consistent with our earlier results mutation of itk m409 f500 and d539 to alanine within full length itk also inactivated the kinase problems with cloning prevented us from testing the activity of the fulllength itk h479a mutant together itk m409 l420 h479 f500 d539 m410 and w355 form a conserved allosteric signaling network that is absolutely required for the activity of itk based on sequence conservation the extended regulatory spine defined here likely controls the activity of the entire tec kinase family  phosphorylation on the activation loop tyrosine is not required for the activity of the btk t474m mutant  it is well established that activation loop phosphorylation is required for activation of tyrosine kinases1 8 and specifically for the tec kinases phosphorylation on the activation loop tyrosine results in at least a tenfold increase in activity21 25 structures of active and inactive kinase domains from a number of different kinases demonstrate a conserved electrostatic network that switches between the active and inactive conformations fig 4a1 8 in the inactive state of btk the conserved glutamate btk e445 on the chelix of the lysglu ion pair is associated with a conserved arginine btk r544 on the activation loop24 26 activation of btk by phosphorylation on btk y551 the activation loop tyrosine leads to a specific interaction between py551 and r544 and a concomitant loss of the association between the r544 and e44524 26 btk e445 on the chelix then swings toward the kinase active site and associates with the conserved lysine side chain btk k430 to bring about the assembly of the active state of the kinase24 26 the conformational adjustment of the chelix brings m449 and m450 in line with the other residues of the regulatory spine fig 4a thus phosphorylation on the activation loop tyrosine is an initiating step in the process of regulatory spine assembly  figure 4 figure 4 the regulatory spine is preassembled in the btk t474m gatekeeper mutant since mutation of the gatekeeper residue to methioine appears to stabilize the regulatory spine within btk we next probed the requirement of activation loop phosphorylation in the context of the t474m gatekeeper mutation the activity of the btkt474my551f double mutant was compared to that of the btk t474m mutant by monitoring phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate we find that mutation of the activation loop btk y551 to phenylalanine has no effect on the activity of the btk t474m mutant fig 4b & c the btk t474my551f double mutant and the btk t474m single mutant are both active whereas the wild type btk kinase requires activation loop phosphorylation the btk y551f single mutant exhibits poor activity fig 4b these data are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation on the activation loop tyrosine initiates the assembly of the regulatory spine by disrupting the association between btk e445 and btk r544 once py551 competes with e445 for association with r544 the e445k430 salt bridge is formed bringing the chelix and importantly m449 into the regulatory spine structure under conditions that preorganize the regulatory spine structure as in the btk t474m mutant phosphorylation on the activation loop y551 is no longer required to trigger the conformational changes that accompany btk activation  we further tested the importance of this switched electrostatic network by mutating btk r544 we reasoned that mutation of btk r544 will activate the kinase as inward movement of the chelix is restrained by the e445r544 interaction and loss of this electrostatic interaction should facilitate movement of the chelix indeed mutation of btk r544 to serine in the context of wildtype isolated kinase domain of btk leads to a twofold increase in activity fig 4d & e in contrast mutation of btk r544 to serine in the context of btk t474m isolated kinase domain does not further activate the kinase fig 4d & e these results again suggest that preassembly of the kinase regulatory spine by mutation can overcome the regulatory interactions that normally control kinase activity thus for the wildtype kinase under physiological conditions phosphorylation on the activation loop sets into motion a cascade of events 1 formation of the py551r544 interaction with concomitant disruption of the btk e445r544 interaction 2 inward movement of the chelix and formation of the e445k430 interaction and 3 assembly of the regulatory spine that culminates in the formation of an active kinase fig 4a  go to discussion the structures of the isolated kinase domain of btk in both the active and inactive states have provided significant insight into tec kinase activation24 26 however the lack of a fulllength structure of any tec kinase leaves numerous unanswered questions regarding the regulation of tec kinases while the sh2 domain and the sh2kinase linker region of tec kinases have been shown to be required for the activity of tec kinases12 13 14 the mechanism by which these regulatory domains positively influence catalytic activity has not been clear here we identify an intramolecular allosteric signaling network that extends from the sh2kinase linker into the kinase domain of tec kinases this intramolecular connectivity defines how the noncatalytic tec regulatory domains through the sh2kinase linker region impinge on the kinase domain and stabilize the regulatory spine in the absence of the tec regulatory domains whether achieved by deletion or conformational changes within the fulllength molecule the regulatory spine is disrupted and kinase activity is inhibited  comparing our results to those previously published for pka shows that the tec kinases require an extended spine structure and it is this longer regulatory spine that couples kinase activity to regions outside of the kinase domain specifically a conserved methionine in the chelix and a conserved tryptophan in the sh2linker swing in to cap the spine in the active btk structure and are critical for the activity of the tec kinases mutation of these extended spine residues disables kinase activity even if the core residues defined for pka are intact  further support for the importance of the entire regulatory spine comes from examination of the genetic mutations in btk that are associated with xlinked agammaglobulinemia xla in humans a disease that is characterized by impaired b cell development27 several of the extended regulatory spine residues identified in this study are mutated in xla patients27 in addition to nonsense mutations at btk m449 m450 and w395 which cause premature truncation of the protein there are also missense mutations at btk m450 f450 and d579 m450i f450s and d579v these mutations likely destabilize the regulatory spine and prevent btk kinase activation  activation loop tyrosine phosphorylation has long been known to influence kinase activity in addition to priming the kinase domain for the assembly of the regulatory spine phosphorylation on the conserved tyr of the activation loop is also thought to stabilize the substratebinding site of the activation loop1 however our work has shown that in the context of the activating gatekeeper btk t474m mutation loss of y551 phosphorylation by mutation to phenylalanine has no affect on substrate phosphorylation preassembly of the regulatory spine mutation of t474m removes any requirement for activation loop phosphorylation these results are consistent with earlier studies that focused on phosphorylation of y551 in btk25 that earlier work did show that phosphorylation on btk y551 significantly alters catalytic activity of btk kcat of the btk y551f mutant is greatly diminished compared to wildtype btk presumably due to loss of the trigger for regulatory spine assembly however the affinity for a peptide substrate is unaffected by y551 phosphorylation km of a peptide substrate for btk y551f mutant is the same as wildtype btk as well an alternative direct substrate docking mechanism has been identified for the tec kinases in which an sh2 domain within the substrate docks onto the kinase domain outside of the active site and facilitates substrate phosphorylation28 29 30 it is therefore possible that the peptide substratebinding region on the activation loop may only play a minor role in substrate recognition in tec kinases and that activation loop phosphorylation plays one significant role initiation of spine assembly by altering electrostatic interactions in and around the active site  we have previously shown that the regulation of tec family kinases is similar to that of csk cterminal src kinase14 unlike the src and abl family of kinases the sh3 and sh2 regulatory domains of csk and tec kinases positively influence the catalytic activity of the kinase domain14 16 like itk and btk the isolated kinase domain of csk has poor catalytic activity16 31 32 in order to define the elements within the csk kinase domain that are responsible for the poor catalytic activity a mutagenesis study was carried out in which srccsk kinase domain chimeras were created33 a srccsk chimeric kinase domain where the nterminal lobe of csk was replaced with the nterminal lobe of src was shown to exhibit activity comparable to that of fulllength csk33 further mutagenesis of the nterminal lobe identified the chelix and the \\u03b2 turn between the \\u03b24 and \\u03b25 strands the top of the regulatory spine as key structural elements that are required for the activity of the isolated kinase domain of csk33  there is remarkable correlation between the elements that are identified in the csk mutagenesis study and the extended regulatory spine of tec kinases identified in this study since the csk and tec family kinases are both positively regulated by domains outside of the kinase domain it is not surprising that they would share the key determinants of catalytic activity indeed as suggested in the original identification of the kinase regulatory spine9 this feature likely plays a critical role in all active kinases our work confirms this notion for the tec family kinases and illustrates that extension of the regulatory spine by two residues couples this regulatory feature to allosteric events occurring outside of the kinase domain moreover our data suggest that despite a high degree of sequence conservation the five core regulatory spine residues do not assemble into the active conformation in the context of the isolated itk or btk kinase domains the energetics of spine assembly seem to be tailored for each specific regulatory environment the tec kinase domains are maintained in their inactive state spine assembly does not occur even when the activation loop is phosphorylated until additional regions of the protein in this case the sh2linker are present to drive complete spine assembly forward and fully activate the kinase\",\n          \"more than 50 of transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder show loss of heterozygosity of a region spanning the tsc1 locus at 9q34 and mutations of tsc1 have been identified in 145 of tumours these comprise nonsense mutations splicing mutations small deletions and missense mutations missense mutations are only rarely found in the germline in tsc disease therefore we have examined six somatic missense mutations found in bladder cancer to determine whether these result in loss of function we describe loss of function via distinct mechanisms five mutations caused mutually exclusive defects at mrna and protein levels of these two mutations caused premrna splicing errors that were predicted to result in premature protein truncation and three resulted in markedly reduced stability of exogenous tsc1 protein primary tumours with aberrant tsc1 premrna splicing were confirmed as negative for tsc1 expression by immunohistochemistry expression was also significantly reduced in a tumour with a tsc1 missense mutation resulting in diminished protein halflife a single tsc1 missense mutation identified in a tumour with retained heterozygosity of the tsc1 region on chromosome 9 caused an apparently tsc2 and mtorindependent localization defect of the mutant protein we conclude that although tsc1 missense mutations do not play a major role in causation of tsc disease they represent a significant proportion of somatic loss of function mutations in bladder cancer  go to introduction tuberous sclerosis complex tsc is an autosomal dominant tumour suppressor gene syndrome with an incidence of 1 in 600010 000 births tsc is characterized by the development of benign growths called hamartomas in the kidneys heart brain and skin and patients present clinically with a variety of developmental disorders 1 tsc is caused by mutations affecting either of the tumour suppressor genes tsc1 or tsc2 tsc1 on chromosome 9q34 encodes hamartin 2 and tsc2 on chromosome 16p133 encodes tuberin 3 approximately half of large tsc families show linkage to 9q34 and half to 16p133 46 tumour development in tsc patients is thought to occur as the result of a somatic secondhit in either tsc1 or tsc2 according to knudsons tumour suppressor model 7 loss of heterozygosity loh of tsc1 or tsc2 has been reported in some tsc hamartomas such as renal angiomyolipomas however loss of the wildtype allele in brain lesions is rare suggesting the possibility of tissuespecific haploinsufficiency of tsc genes 810  colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation of tsc1 and tsc2 in mammalian cells 1112 and direct binding in yeast twohybrid assays provide a tentative explanation for the similar disease phenotype in tsc patients with mutations in either tsc1 or tsc2 genes 213 functionally the tsc1tsc2 complex is positioned at the centre of multiple growth signalling pathways and is a key integrator of signals controlling protein translation and cell growth 14 activation of the tsc1tsc2 complex in growthlimiting conditions attenuates signalling through mtor via specific gtpase activating protein gap activity of tsc2 towards rheb 1516  while epithelial malignancy is not a common feature of tsc studies in this laboratory and others have implicated loss of function of tsc1 in bladder tumorigenesis 1719 loss of heterozygosity loh for markers on chromosome 9 is observed in more than 50 of bladder tumours of all grades and stages 20 and subchromosomal loh analyses have identified the tsc1 locus at 9q34 as a common critical region of deletion between markers d9s149 and d9s66 192123 to date we have screened 154 bladder tumours by fluorescent single strand conformation polymorphism fsscp analysis and direct sequencing and found an overall mutation frequency of 145 the mutation spectrum comprises nonsense 35 missense 26 frameshift 26 inframe deletions 3 and splicing 10 mutations 24 platt et al in preparation in all cases but one tsc1 missense mutations were tumourspecific somatic events tsc1 is the only gene on 9q that has been found to be mutated in bladder tumours and may therefore be the critical gene on this chromosome arm implicated in >50 of all bladder tumours  missense mutations of tsc1 have not routinely been confirmed as functionally inactivating in tsc disease though two recent reports provide evidence that in a few cases these are likely to be diseasecausing 2526 here we sought to determine whether the tsc1 missense mutations identified in bladder tumours constituted inactivating mutations we anticipated that discrete amino acid changes of mutant proteins might allow the identification of functionally important residues wildtype and mutant tsc1 constructs were retrovirally delivered into tsc1null bladder tumour cell lines and functionally characterized all somatic tsc1 missense mutations perturbed tsc1 function by causing aberrant splicing protein instability or protein mislocalization defects were confirmed in primary tumours by rtpcr analysis of mutant transcripts and immunohistochemical analysis  go to results missense mutations of tsc1 identified in bladder tumours  previously we identified 8 mutations including 2 missense mutations in a series of 62 bladder tumours 24 screening of an additional 92 tumours platt et al in preparation identified an additional 15 mutations of which 4 were missense mutations in total therefore 6 missense mutations have been identified in 154 tumours representing 26 of all mutations found table 1 mutations were determined as tumourspecific by genotyping of paired tumour and blood samples 1250c>t thr417ile was previously described in the germline in tsc disease in japanese patients but was not confirmed as causative of tsc 2728 1250c>t was also identified in our laboratory in the patients constitutional dna and the tumour sample retained heterozygosity for microsatellite markers at the tsc1 gene locus 24 threonine 417 was previously identified as a site of cdk1dependent phosphorylation 29 to determine the biological significance of this variant 1250c>t thr417ile was characterized here alongside tumourspecific missense mutations five of six other tumours with tsc1 missense mutations showed loh for markers at the tsc1 locus table 1 there was no relationship between mutation and tumour stage or grade missense mutations were predominantly nterminal but did not localize to a common functional domain fig 1  figure 1 figure 1 positions of amino acid substitutions in relation to described functional domains of hamartin table

less conservative and phe158cys and phe216asp are least conservative table 1  reexpression of missense mutant tsc1 proteins in tsc1null urothelial cells  we anticipated that missense mutations might lead to loss of function at the amino acid level thus our initial approach was to express wildtype and missense mutant tsc1 cdnas in tsc1null bladder cell lines and investigate function of the mutant proteins missense mutant proteins were cterminally flag or gfptagged expressed in 971 and hcv29 cells and characterized for tsc2 binding activity and mtor suppressive activity in nutrientstarved conditions  expression of mutant proteins was investigated by immunoblotting following retroviral transduction and selection of neomycin resistant mass cell populations expression levels of mutant proteins were markedly different ser35cys his105arg phe216asp and thr417ile were expressed at high levels similar to wildtype protein whereas his68arg and phe158cys were much reduced and his206asp was not detected fig 2a repeated independent infections of these two cell lines and of telomeraseimmortalized normal human urothelial cells tertnhuc and assessment of mass populations of cells following selection resulted in entirely reproducible expression levels of all mutant proteins data not shown the transcription of missense rna was confirmed by real time rtpcr and uniform levels of wildtype and missense transcripts were detected fig 2b the consistently reduced or absent protein expression of his68arg and phe158cys and his206asp missense mutant forms despite the presence of rna expression suggested possible effects of these missense changes on protein stability  figure 2 figure 2 a immunoblot showing levels of wildtype and mutant tsc1flag proteins and endogenous tsc2 in 971 cell lines b measurement of tsc1 rna levels by real time rtpcr analysis of wildtype and mutant tsc1flag mrna transcript levels in 971 cell  mutant tsc1 proteins retain interaction with tsc2  the interaction between tsc1 and tsc2 appears to be important in maintaining the stability of each of the proteins tsc1tsc2 binding specifically augments tsc2 expression by limiting its ubiquitination 3132 tsc2 gap activity towards rheb defines tsc12 mediated control of mtor signalling and phosphorylation of downstream effectors of mtor is constitutive and refractory to amino acid withdrawal in cells lacking tsc1 or tsc2 3335 where expressed missense mutant tsc1 proteins stabilized tsc2 levels in 971 cells fig 2a and coimmunoprecipitated with it fig 3a however our data cannot exclude minor effects on

his206aspgfp in hcv29 cells suggesting some stabilizing effect of the gfp tag tsc2 coimmunoprecipitation and s6 phosphorylation assays were not accurately quantitative but expression of all missense mutant proteins in tsc1null cells reduced s6 phosphorylation in amino acid starved conditions relative to vector alone fig 3b indicating that none of these mutant forms of tsc1 abolish interaction with tsc2  aberrant rna splicing caused by tsc1 missense mutations  highlevel expression and tsc2 binding activity of tsc1 ser35cys his105arg and phe216ala proteins suggested no functional effect of amino acid substitutions caused by 104c>g 314a>g and 648t>a missense mutations however the expression of proteins from exogenous missense cdnas did not allow the assessment of possible effects of mutations at the premrna level we speculated that tsc1 missense mutations may cause loss of function through introduction of splicing errors in mutant transcripts in vivo therefore wildtype and missense mutant tsc1 premrna sequences were screened for effects of mutations on splice site definition using the neural network algorithm httpwwwfruitflyorgseqtoolssplicehtml  interestingly significant differences were seen between splice site scores of wildtype and 104c>g and 314a>g tsc1 transcripts the 104c>g mutation positioned 3 bp upstream of the tsc1 exon 34 junction resulted in a reduced exon 34 splice motif score the 314a>g mutation resulted in the introduction of a highscoring 5\\u2032 donor splice site immediately upstream of the ag transversion by generation of a novel consensus splice motif no differences in splice site scores were observed between wildtype and 648t>a or 1250c>t transcripts or between wildtype and mutant transcripts that generated low exogenous protein expression  to examine splicing of missense mutant tsc1 transcripts fragments spanning the mutation site and flanking intronexon junctions were amplified from respective tumour cdnas by rtpcr and sequenced an rtpcr product reproducibly amplified from cdna of the tumour containing 104c>g showed increased electrophoretic mobility relative to a control fragment amplified from tertnhuc cdna fig 4a sequencing of the tumour product revealed use of a cryptic 5\\u2032 donor site in exon 4 the adjacent downstream exon to the 104c>g mutant exon supplementary material fig s1 the reduced splice motif score at the exon 34 junction was shown to have no effect on exon 34 splicing if translated this 104c>g mutant transcript would generate 26 new amino acids from an alternate reading frame and truncate prematurely at residue 79  figure 4 figure 4 semi quantitative rtpcr analysis of tsc1 rna in normal urothelial cells and tsc1 mutant tumour samples showing increased electrophoretic mobility of rtpcr products amplified from cdna from tumours containing tsc1 104c>g a  a faster migrating band was also reproducibly amplified from cdna of the tumour containing 314a>g fig 4b compared to control tertnhuc cdna sequence analysis of pcr products revealed a 50nucleotide deletion in the transcript generated from the missense allele the 314a>g mutation created a de novo 5\\u2032 donor splice site immediately upstream of 314a>g and resulted in the splicing of 50 nucleotides from the 3\\u2032 end of exon 5 the effect seen at the mrna level was entirely consistent with the prediction made by in silico analysis if translated the 314a>g mutant transcript is expected to generate two new cterminal amino acids and truncate prematurely at residue 107  exon skipping through introduction of a de novo 5\\u2032 splice site by point mutation is a relatively welldescribed mechanism of aberrant premrna splicing 3638 no normal transcript was amplified from cdna from tumours containing tsc1 104c>g or 314a>g mutations suggesting that all splicing occurs via the novel sites the abundance of missense transcripts appeared lower than normal transcript by semiquantitative rtpcr when standardized to hprt however by real time rtpcr tsc1 transcript abundance was relatively higher in tumours with tsc1 missense mutations causing transcript splicing or protein stability defects than in uncultured or cultured tertnhuc when standardized to sdha data not shown  missense mutant tsc1 proteins exhibit reduced protein stability  the demonstration of consistently lowlevel exogenous protein expression despite uniform mrna transcript abundance suggested diminished stability of tsc1 his68arg phe158cys and his206asp mutant proteins by inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide we determined that his68arg phe158cys and his206asp mutant proteins were turnedover relatively faster than wildtype tsc1 in a proteasomedependent manner fig 5 a and b and data not shown moreover by 35s labelling we were able to show that his68arg phe158cys and his206asp proteins had markedly shorter halflives than wildtype tsc1 fig 5c  figure 5 figure 5 a immunoblot showing turnover of wildtype and s35c and h68r missense tsc1 proteins in cycloheximide chxtreated cells cells were cultured in full growth medium supplemented with 100 \\u00b5gml chx or dmso vehicle alone and lysed at timepoints  phe216ala tsc1 protein shows altered localization  previous studies have described a granular cytoplasmic localization of endogenous tsc1 in vitro and in vivo and also of overexpressed tsc1 in cos7 cells 3941 localization of monomeric tsc1 and of tsc1 complexed with tsc2 is likely influenced by culture conditions given that components of the aktmtor signalling cascade are membrane localized when activated in addition tsc2 is reported to shuttle into the nucleus in a cell cycle and phosphorylationdependent manner 4244  it was anticipated that the characterization of discrete missense amino acid changes may offer insight into potentially mtorindependent or bladderspecific functions of tsc1 our results indicated that tsc1 104c>g 203a>g 314a>g 473t>g and 616c>g missense mutations cause loss of function by generic mechanisms of altered message or reduced protein stability however sequencing of rtpcr products amplified from cdna from the tumour containing the tsc1 648t>a mutation showed no altered splicing of the mutant transcript also at the protein level phe216ala was expressed at high levels similar to wildtype tsc1 the substitution of a phenylalanine residue for an alanine residue constitutes the loss of a highmolecular weight hydrophobic benzyl group and is assigned a nonconservative 2 blosum62 score the lack of effect on splicing or protein stability raised the possibility that this mutation may cause a defect in tsc1 protein function per se  we determined the localization of gfptagged mutant proteins in nutrient replete and deficient conditions wildtype phe216ala ser35cys his68arg and thr417ile proteins were compared in complete growth medium wildtype tsc1 and ser35cys his68arg and thr417ile mutant proteins showed diffuse punctate cytoplasmic distribution with distinct cytoplasmic foci in amino acid deficient medium these proteins became localized almost exclusively to large cytoplasmic bodies intriguingly the phe216ala substitution markedly altered the localization of tsc1 phe216ala was exclusively cytoplasmic and diffuse in full growth medium and did not redistribute to discrete bodies in amino acid deficient conditions fig 6 however it was shown to stabilize and to coimmunoprecipitate with endogenous tsc2 and to attenuate growth signalling through mtor in starved conditions fig 3b these observations were reproduced in tsc1transduced 971 and hcv29 cell lines and tertnhuc and suggest that localization of tsc1 to cytoplasmic foci is not a requirement for tsc2 binding or negative regulation of mtor also defective localization of phe216ala is likely tsc2 and mtorindependent possibly suggesting an independent function of tsc1 at cytoplasmic foci  figure 6 figure 6 localization of wildtype tsc1 a and tsc1

unlike the other five tumours with missense mutations the tumour containing the tsc1 648t>a mutation did not show loh of 9q as confirmed by analysis of pure microdissected tumour cell populations data not shown both normal and mutant alleles were detected by sequencing of tumour cdna  tsc1 protein expression in bladder tumour tissues  to examine the effects of premrna splicing defects and protein stability defects caused by missense mutations at the tumour level tsc1 mutant and wildtype tumours were screened for expression of tsc1 protein by immunohistochemistry sensitivity and specificity of a rabbit monoclonal antitsc1 antibody was confirmed by staining of paraffinembedded pellets of tsc1null hcv29 cells and hcv29 in which wildtype tsc1 had been reexpressed fig 7a and d normal ureter showed strong cytoplasmic tsc1 expression in the urothelium fig 7e tumours with wildtype tsc1 showed strong cytoplasmic staining fig 7f and a tumour with a tsc1 7377\\u03b4 5 small deletion causing premature truncation at residue 27 showed no tsc1 expression fig 7c both tumours with homozygous tsc1 missense mutations causing premrna splicing defects were negative for tsc1 expression fig 7g and h figure 7h shows normal urothelium with strong tsc1 staining adjacent to immunonegative tsc1 314a>g mutant tumour cells the 648t>a phe216ala mutant tumour showed moderate tsc1 expression consistent with normal stability of the phe216ala protein and retention of chromosome 9q heterozygosity in the tumour fig 7i of the three missense mutations causing reduced protein stability tsc1 203a>g 473t>g and 616c>g tumour material was available only for the 616c>g his206asp mutant sample the 616c>g mutation was identified from tumour material resected in 2003 and tsc1 expression was shown to be low in three tumour resections from this patient in successive years fig 7jl  figure 7 figure 7 tsc1 immunostaining of hcv29 neo a and tsc1 d cell pellets normal ureter negative b and positive e antibody controls and tsc1 7377\\u03b4 5 c and tsc1 wildtype f bladder tumours tsc1 staining of tsc1 missense mutant bladder  go to discussion we have demonstrated that bladder tumourderived tsc1 missense mutations result in loss of tsc1 function and that this occurs via distinct mechanisms an overall tsc1 mutation frequency of \\u223c145 is found in bladder cancer 24 platt et al in preparation and missense mutations comprise 26 of mutations found to date the identification of deleterious missense mutations in bladder tumours indicates a causative role of loss of tsc1 function via this mechanism in bladder tumorigenesis the vast majority of tsc1 mutations in tsc disease are predicted to be protein truncating in nature and no significant genotypephenotype correlations have been observed 254548 nonchain terminating tsc1 mutations missense or inframe deletions are rare in tsc disease 27474950 wwwlovdnltsc1 although missense mutations have been reported previously most have not been confirmed as diseasecausing several have been revealed as rare polymorphisms or associated with other nonsense mutations in the same patient 4650 others have been disregarded as potentially diseasecausing on the basis of conservative amino acid changes or have not been characterized further 2751 however a recent publication by jansen et al 26 that identified three missense mutations l916r m224r and e412v in affected individuals reported functional analyses on two of these it was reported that e412v affected rna splicing interestingly in transfections of constructs of wildtype tsc1 and the m224r variant the latter showed lower levels of protein expression that were unable to completely suppress s6 phosphorylation results similar to those described here for missense variants with reduced protein halflife  we have shown that two of six bladder tumourderived missense mutations result in premrna splicing defects three lead to reduced stability of mutant proteins and intriguingly one mutation causes a tsc2 and mtorindependent localization defect of the mutant protein wildtype tsc1 showed a granular cytoplasmic distribution in cells in full growth medium and became localized almost exclusively to large cytoplasmic bodies in amino acid starved cells in contrast tsc1 was cytoplasmic and diffuse in serumstarved cells preliminary results indicated that tsc1 bodies were dynamic nonaggresomal structures data not shown interestingly the phe216ala substitution abolished the localization of tsc1 to these bodies as expected from its position outside the recognized tsc2 binding domain tsc1 phe216ala retained tsc2 binding activity and mtor suppressive activity in amino acid starved conditions suggesting that localization of tsc1 to cytoplasmic foci was not a requirement for tsc2 binding or for suppression of mtor signalling this may also suggest that tsc1 has a separable function at cytoplasmic foci that is independent of tsc2 and independent of negative regulation of mtor by tsc1tsc2 however it is not clear whether the formation of intensely staining bodies in conditions of overexpression of tsc1 andor tsc2 3952 is relevant to the normal physiological condition further investigation of the function of phe216ala is now required ideally at levels of expression that are closer to normal and in both tsc1null cells and those expressing endogenous wildtype tsc1  although the missense variant 1250c>t t417i was found in the patients germline and this patient showed no symptoms of tsc we included this variant in our analyses as threonine 417 has previously been identified as a site of cdk1dependent phosphorylation 29 we found no evidence for a functional defect and conclude that this represents a rare polymorphism as this patient was japanese as were both tsc patients in whom this variant was reported previously 2728 this rare variant may be confined to the japanese population  evidence suggests that cisacting mutations affecting splicing of some tumour suppressor genes can have causal roles in tumour initiation and progression 53 predicted and confirmed effects of tscrelated and bladder tumourderived tsc1 missense changes on premrna splicing reported here underscore the importance of using rnabased techniques together with conventional mutation detection methods to effectively identify diseasecausing mutations one of the mutations that deleteriously affected splicing 104c>g had an unexpected effect the use of a cryptic 5\\u2032 donor site in an adjacent downstream exon is a nonconventional splicing event diseaseassociated mutations at splice junctions typically result in skipping of the mutant exon 385455 the 104c>g mutation was shown to reduce the exon 3 5\\u2032 splice site motif score and to disrupt an enhancer sequence spanning exon 34 104c>g also disrupts a u1 snrnabinding motif spanning the 5\\u2032 splice site from position 3 to +8 supplementary material fig s1 in combination with a normally lowscoring exon 4 3\\u2032 acceptor site these factors may result in reduced splicing efficiency of introns 34 spliceosome assembly is directed by juxtaposed splicing elements and were introns 45 to splice first splicing machinery at the 3\\u2032 acceptor site of exon 4 may stimulate recruitment of u1 snrna to possible binding sites in exon 4 and result in use of a cryptic 5\\u2032 donor site  in bladder tumours as in tsc disease nonsense deletion and frameshift tsc1 mutations result in premature protein truncation and loss of protein function we have now shown that missense mutations cause loss of function by aberrant splicing or reduced protein stability the identification of tumourspecific tsc1 mutations in the context of chromosome 9 loh argues strongly for a direct role of loss of tsc1 function in the aetiology of these tumours these data are consistent with tsc1 acting as a tumour suppressor gene in bladder cancer in accordance with knudsens twohit hypothesis biallelic inactivation of tsc1 or tsc2 may not be necessarily required in some tscrelated tumours 9 the discrepancy between frequency of tsc1 mutation and frequency of loh in the tsc1 gene region in bladder tumours suggests that haploinsufficiency of tsc1 may contribute to tumour development in some cases loh of chromosome 9 is a particularly frequent event in bladder cancer and to date tsc1 is the only gene on 9q found to be mutated in bladder tumours the contribution of partial loss of tsc1 to clonal expansion of tumour cells with 9q loh is unknown and haploinsufficiency remains a possibility in those bladder tumours with 9q loh and no tsc1 mutation loh at the tsc1 locus may accompany another event driving loss of chromosome 9 deletion of the cdkn2a locus at 9p21 which occurs in up to 50 of bladder tumours 5657 or of an as yet unidentified chromosome 9 tumour suppressor gene may constitute such a driving force loss of one copy of tsc1 may therefore be an advantageous gratuitous hit or passenger event 58  tsc is not a cancer prone syndrome and tsc lesions very rarely progress to malignancy that tsc patients do not have an increased risk of developing bladder cancer or other sporadic cancers may be explained by the requirement of cumulative genetic insults and the typically late onset of malignant disease the timing and order of initiating and subsequent genetic events in hamartoma and bladder tumour development is likely to be critical in determining malignant potential why tsc1 appears to be involved in bladder cancer and not other epithelial cancers is an unresolved question  frequent loh of 9q is found in other tumour types including ovarian carcinoma gallbladder carcinoma nasopharyngeal carcinoma and nonsmall cell lung cancer 5965 however reports of tsc1 and tsc2 mutation status in sporadic tumours other than bladder are very few no mutations were observed in sporadic glial and glioneuronal tumours or renal cell carcinomas 6667 fiftythree and 39 of lung adenocarcinomas and precursor lesions respectively were found to have loh of 9q 68 subsequently a screen of 47 lung adenocarcinomas identified three confirmed tsc1 mutations however loh and mutations were not detected simultaneously 69  in ovarian carcinoma gallbladder carcinoma nasopharyngeal carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma loh or deletion is described in both tsc gene regions 63687071 if loss of tsc12 complex function is the pathogenic effect of loss of tsc1 it may be expected that bladder tumours would also show loss of tsc2 function in an loh screen of 16p we have detected loh for markers at the tsc2 locus in 16 of bladder tumours platt et al in preparation it will be important to screen for mutations in the retained copy of tsc2 in cases with loh to determine whether there is also an involvement of tsc2 or whether there is an important independent role of tsc1 in urothelial cells  abstract we have surveyed the mutations of tsc1 and tsc2 from 38 25 sporadic 11 familial and 2 unknown japanese patients with tuberous sclerosis complex in 23 of 38 subjects we detected 18 new mutations in addition to 4 mutations that had been previously reported we also found 3 new polymorphisms the mutations were not clustered on a particular exon in either of the genes seven tsc1 mutations found in 3 familial and 4 sporadic cases were on the exons 3 missense 2 nonsense point mutations a 1base insertion and a 2bp deletion fifteen tsc2 mutations were found in 5 familial cases 10 sporadic cases and 1 unknown case the 12 mutations were on the exons 8 missense 1 nonsense point mutations a 1bp insertion a 5 bp deletion and a 4bp replacement and 3 point mutations were on the exonintron junctions although the patients with tsc2 mutations tend to exhibit relatively severe mental retardation in comparison to those with tsc1 mutations a genotypephenotype correlation could not yet be established the widespread distribution of tsc1tsc2 mutations hinders the development of a simple diagnostic test and the

mutation lies outside of the coding sequence either in the 59regulatory elements within the intronic sequences or in the 39 utr in addition a largescale rearrangement of genomic dna may yield true negative results in the sscp of the coding exons although there is no report of a largescale mutation in tsc1 there are indeed some in tsc2 jones et al 1997 the european chromosome 16 tuberous sclerosis consortium 1993 au et al 1997 van slegtenhorst et al 1997 the mutation surveys of tsc1tsc2 genes in caucasian tsc patients revealed no clustering of the mutation in either gene wilson et al 1996 jones et al 1997 van slegtenhorst et al 1997 au et al 1998 in accordance with these previous findings the 22 mutations 18 new and 4 reported found in this study were distributed on various exons and there was no clustering of the mutations again in accordance with the previous findings there was no obvious relationship between the type and location of the mutation and the clinical symptoms however the patients with tsc2 mutations appeared to have more severe mental retardation compared with the patients with tsc1 mutations the same tendency has been noted jones et al 1997 it is therefore at least clear that the clinical phenotype cannot be predicted from the genotype because of the heterogeneity of the mutations it also appears impossible at present to develop a simple

dental university for collecting the samples of the tsc patients this work was supported by the ministry of health and welfare of japan by a special grant for neurocutaneous disease and by the ministry of education science sport and culture of japan by a grantinaid for scientific research  twentyseven japanese patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex tsc consisting of 23 sporadic and 4 familial cases were tested for mutations in the tsc1 and tsc2 genes using singlestrand conformational polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing four possible pathogenic mutations were found in the tsc1 gene including three frame shifts and a nonsense mutation in a familial case all mutations were expected to result in a truncated hamartin gene product the tsc2 gene analysis identified six possible pathogenic mutations only in the sporadic cases including two frame shifts one inframe deletion and three missense mutations two of the tsc2 mutations were expected to result in a truncated tuberin gene product these results of the japanese tsc patients were compatible with the reports from europe and the united states ie 1 tsc1 mutations are rarer in sporadic cases than in familial cases 2 substantial numbers of sporadic cases arise from mutations in the tsc2 gene and 3 mutations of the tsc1 gene may cause premature truncation of hamartin\"\n        ],\n
