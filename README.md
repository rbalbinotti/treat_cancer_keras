# Personalized Medicine - Redefining Cancer Treatment.
**Course - Machine Learning** 
Project from the Data Scientist Training Program by the Data Science Academy

## Project Description
Much has been said in recent years about how precision medicine and, more specifically, genetic testing will disrupt the treatment of diseases such as cancer. However, this is still happening only partially due to the enormous amount of manual work still required. In this project, we will attempt to bring personalized medicine to its full potential. Once sequenced, a cancerous tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. The challenge is to distinguish the mutations that contribute to tumor growth from other mutations.

Currently, this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task, where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify each genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature. For this project, the [MSKCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Sloan_Kettering_Cancer_Center) is providing an expert-annotated knowledge base, where world-class researchers and oncologists have manually annotated thousands of mutations.

> The goal of the project is to develop a **Machine Learning algorithm using Keras and TensorFlow**.

For building this project, the dataset is available for download at the following link:
